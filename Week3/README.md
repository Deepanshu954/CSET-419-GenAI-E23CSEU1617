# Week 3 Lab: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

This directory contains the implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on the MNIST dataset, as per the Week 3 Lab instructions for CSET419 – Introduction to Generative AI.

## Project Structure
- `vae_lab.py`: Main Python script implementing the VAE architecture, training loop, and visualization.
- `VAE_Documentation.md`: Detailed explanation of VAE concepts and the code implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `GenAI-Lab-Week3.docx`: Original lab instructions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:
  - `torch`
  - `torchvision`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

## Installation
1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the main script to download the dataset, train the model, and generate outputs:
```bash
python3 vae_lab.py
```

## Outputs
After running the script, the following artifacts will be generated (and are excluded from git):
- `vae_model.pth`: Saved model weights.
- `loss_curve.png`: Plot of training loss over epochs.
- `samples.png`: Grid of digits generated by sampling from the latent space.
- `latent_space.png`: Visualization of the 2D latent space (if `LATENT_DIM=2`).
